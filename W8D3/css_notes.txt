Positioning 
--------------
	- Static 
	- Relative 
	- Absolute
	- Fixed \

Static 
- Default behavior for everything is static. 
- Shows up where expected 
- Takes up space in the document flow. 
- Informally "not positioned" 

Relative 
	 - Shows up where expected.
	 - Always takes up space in the document flow 
	 - Can be nudged left/right and top/bottom 
	 - Coordinates are relative to its original position. 
	 - When nudged, leaves original gap on the page.
	 - Anything relative is in a layer on top of everything static. 
	 - Allows Z-Index 
	 - Creates a new coordinate system for anything children positioned absolute. 

Absolute 
	- Does NOT take up space in the document flow 
	- Lifted up and placed on top of anything static. 
	- Show by default where expected.
	- Coordinate system is that of the nearest ancestor that is NOT static positioned. If none, default is the window.  
	- Creates a new coordinate system for any children positioned absolute. 
	- Top/bottom and left/right together, if no height is set, which stretches the element out. 
	- Take up minimal space for content. 

Fixed 
	- Behaves similar to Absolute 
	- FIxed to the window (does not scroll along with the document). 
	- Coordinate systems is always the window.
	- Use with caution. 
	

Z - Index 
 - Is just a number 
 - The greater the number the closer to the viewer 
 - Negative numbers are behind everything static. 
 - Positive numbers are always greater than negative numbers in z-index. 
 - Nesting does matter. 
 - Only applies to elements positioned relative, absolute and fixed
 
 Overflow
	- By default a block container expands vertically to accommodate its content
	- If you set a fixed height on an element, but the content needs more space, it flows out of it by default	
	- With the overflow property we can control what happens when content does not fit
	- Weird gotcha: If the overflow: hidden property is set on a static element, it can only clip static children
	- To clip absolute positioned children with this property, the parent cannot be positioned static itself but will have to be set to relative (or absolute or fixed)

	Math using calc()
	- Calc is a CSS function that can be used anywhere you may want a length value
	- You can combine different units, making it extremely useful to subtract pixels from percentages
	- You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
	-You can use parentheses to denote order
	- Example: width: calc((100% - 100px) / 2)

Pseudo Content
Used to inject content inside an element
You can inject either after or before the present content inside an element
Acts as inline elements inside element by default
Can take any styling
Needs a declared content property
Content property can be a string or select an element's attribute

h1:before {
	content: "lll" 
}

h1:after {
	content: ":(" 
}
