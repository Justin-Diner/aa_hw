A Class Component is a component that is defined using JavaScript Class syntax and extends the React.Component class from the react package.

To render elements in a Class Component, you must define a render method on the class. The return value of the render method is what will be rendered by the component.

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}

Component props
To access props in a Class Component, you can get the props object on the instance of the class.

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
      </>
    );
  }
}

Component state
In a Class Component, component state must be initialized in the constructor method on the class. To manipulate state key's values, you must use a single method on the class called setState. setState takes in an object with the key value pairs to change on the class's state object.

Creating a Class Component
import { Component } from 'react;
Allows you to render. 

Class componenets "extends Component". 

To create state in a class component you need to make a constructor function.
class CreateClassCOmponent extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {
			name: {
				fname: 'JD'
				lName: 'Richards'
			}
			color: 'yellow'
		}
	}
	render () {
		return (

		)
	}
}

Remember thaT you must call super if creating a constructor method. 
All state is held in one object. The this.state object. 

TO update state, you use .setState. this.setState(object);
