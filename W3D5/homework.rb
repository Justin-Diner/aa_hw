# Data Structures
# Abstract Data Types

# Array can implement a set. The set is the underlying abstract data type. 
# Dictionary (Set (key, value), get (value), delete (key))
# Hashmap is a way at implementing a dictionary. 

# ADTs (Abstract Data Types)
# Stack
# Last In First Out
# Stack#push and Stack#pop
# Normally implemented with an Array. Used in recusrsion. Implicit in any recursion algorithm. 

# Queue
# First in First Out 
# Queue#Enque #Queue#Deque
# Push					Shift
# Unshift 			Pop

# Tree 
# Binary Tree
# Each node has at most two children. Has a parent child relationship where a child has, at most, 1 parent. 

# Ternary Tree
# Has at most three children. 

# Unary Tree - Linked List
# n-ary tree (polytree) - unlimited.

#		Depth of 3 Binary Tree (deepest Leaf)
# 		1 (root)
#	 2		3 (subtree) 	(parent)
#4	5		6		7 (leaves)	(children) 

# Tree Traversal
# BFS - Breadth First Search (layer by layer) - (queue) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# DFS - Depth First Search (Straight to the bottom) (stack) 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7
