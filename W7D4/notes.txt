The Asset Pipeline 
One of the key purposes of the asset pipeline is to group and concatenate source files.
In asset files, header lines--i.e., lines before any code--that begin with *= (or //= or #=) are directives: special comments that tell sprockets which dependencies to load. 
The require_tree . directive will load any file in the current directory (.) or one of its subdirectories. require_self then makes sure that the current file is the last one loaded.

require_tree will load files alphabetically, which may not be the desired order. You can accordingly specify the order in which a folder's files should be loaded by creating an index.css (or whatever extension is appropriate) file inside the folder. The index file can then explicitly set the loading order through a series of *= require <filename> statements.

You can find the overarching manifest for the Asset Pipeline in app/assets/config. 

Compilation
When you deploy your application on Heroku, Heroku will precompile your asset files to public/assets by running the rails assets:precompile task.
The precompilation task involves:

1. Compiling sources from CoffeeScript/Sass to JavaScript/CSS.
2. Concatenating manifest files.
3. Minifying the results.

Heroku
To precompile assets, you can run rails assets:precompile in a production environment. However, you shouldn't need to precompile assets yourself. 

Coding links to assets
The familiar asset tags will link to the precompiled versions of your assets. You don't need to do anything special to use the asset pipeline:
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %>
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
<%= image_tag "rails.png" %>

Media Queries
A media query is a wrapper for CSS code that tests if the device running it meets one or more criteria.
A breakpoint is a width measurement that represents a point at which your site's layout needs a substantial change to accommodate screens in that range. 

Viewport Meta Tag
The last thing you need in addition to media queries to enable a responsive layout is the viewport meta tag:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
You should add this to the <head> of any site you want to make responsive.
